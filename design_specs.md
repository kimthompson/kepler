Design Specs
==============

I thought I should at least write down what else we plan to put where in our visual. This will likely change with user feedback.

**Sliders**
We thought the users would be most interested in filtering by:
+ Stellar Temperature (Star Temperature?)
+ Stellar Size (Star Size?) -- Density
+ Number of Kepler Objects Tied to them (Orbiting Planets?)
+ Button for instantly finding planets more like earth? (KT)

**Hovering Tooltips**
Just the star name and number of orbiting planets.

**Detailed Star Pages**
Pretty much everything we have on everything. It's okay to leave dashes in for unknown traits on this page. Detailed info about star, planets in a circle around it, and detailed info about each of them as well. Some of the more interesting stats are:
+ Period (Year Length in Days)
+ Earth radius
+ Temperature
+ Density -- NOTE: We can use this to guess what a planet is made of, which can form our colors: for example, from gray (metal) to brown (rock) to blue(gas)

**Legends**
We're going to need legends on the main page to show:
1. The scale of the stars
2. The color temperature scale
3. The positioning of all of these stars relative to the night sky (a cutout of the constellation they sit on?)

We're also going to need legends on the detailed Star Pages to show:
1. Their star size and heat compared to our Sun
2. Their planet sizes compared to Earth

*To Joshua*
Please add more to this list as you remember it. I'm having issues collecting up some of my old notes and remembering some of the decisions we made.
